# wormhole-bridge-from-metamask-to-terra-station
I was attempting to transfer funds from metamask to terra station on the bridge.terra.money. but my funds never made it to that wallet. It looks like it was sent to the maker Terra.UST wallet but not sent to my terra station. Is there anything I can do or is my money lost?
